This is an ad-hoc presentation used for presenting SLIME at the 2005
European Common Lisp Meeting in Amsterdam. Fun meeting!

The slideshow was presented in GNU Emacs 21.3 and CMUCL 19a in
800x600. I was running Debian 'testing'.

Usage tips:

  ./run.sh
  M-x eval-buffer
  M-x slime
  M-x present-my-slideshow

Hopefully you have the right fonts! Otherwise you need to find close
enough alternatives, e.g. regular helvetica instead of italic.

Important bindings:

  f - forward slide
  b - backward slide
  / - forward slide with fading special effect
  a - trigger the next "action" for the current slide.
      The only slide with an action is the "SLIM" one.

Technical notes on how it is presented:

  "SLIM" slide: first 'a' to show the snippet then C-c C-c to compile
  it in-place (to show off compiler note annotations).

  "SLIME" slide: `C-x C-e' at the end to evaluate (foo 1) and enter
  debugger. Note that since foo was defun'd on the previous slide the
  'v'iew source command in the debugger will pop to that slide. When
  the debugger is 'q'uit we end up back at the right slide.
