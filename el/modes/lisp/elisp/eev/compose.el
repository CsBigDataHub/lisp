;;; Comment:

;; So you've been asking yourself how I (edrx) type those characters
;; like "", "«" and "»"...
;; Here it is:
;;   "" is with C-q C-o
;;   "«" is with M-, < <
;;   "»" is with M-, > >
;; This file implements the command associated to `M-,'.
;; See: <http://angg.twu.net/eev-current/glyphs.el.html>.
