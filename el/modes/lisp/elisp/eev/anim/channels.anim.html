The animation above shows Emacs sending commands to xterms one line at
a time through "communication channels".

When the user types &lt;F9&gt; Emacs checks if the current line starts with
a "<span class="eev-glyph-face-red">*</span>"; if it does, then the rest of the line is executed as Lisp code,
and if doesn't then the line is sent to the program at the end of the
current communication channel. The user only had to type a series of
&lt;F9&gt;s at the Emacs window for all this to happen.

The line

  <span class="eev-glyph-face-red">*</span> (eechannel-xterm "A") ;; create

creates a xterm "listening to channel A", and sets the default channel
to A; similarly,

  <span class="eev-glyph-face-red">*</span> (eechannel-xterm "B") ;; create

creates a xterm "listening to channel A" and sets the default channel
to B. After that some lines are send to the xterm at channel B, then

  <span class="eev-glyph-face-red">*</span> (eechannel "A") ;; change target

sets the default channel to A; the next lines are sent to A, and so
on.

After executing/sending all those lines the user switches the focus to
an xterm and types "exit" there to close it, and then does the same
with the other xterm. Note that these xterms "listen" to the user's
keystrokes as usual, but _in addition to that_ they also listen to
input from Emacs.
