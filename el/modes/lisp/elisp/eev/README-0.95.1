Note: Eev-0.95.1 is not ready yet, but its README is! Read on...


Eev-0.95.1 is an interim release! Several files in eev-current were
obsolete and had to be removed, and I wanted to save their last
versions somewhere before removing them... I don't use CVS, so the
right thing to do was to create a numbered release - 0.95.1 -
containing everything, and soon after releasing eev-0.95.1 I would
remove the obsolete files from eev-current.

Almost half of the elisp files will be removed:

   To be kept              To be removed
   ==========              =============
   eev.el                  eev-dev.el        
   eev-insert.el           eev-insert-old.el 
   eev-steps.el            eev-walk.el       
   eev-browse-url.el       eev-ttp.el        
                        
   eev-compose.el          compose.el        
   eev-glyphs.el           glyphs.el         
   eev-math-glyphs.el

   eev-langs.el

From the above list of elisp files to be kept only `eev-langs.el' is
still very terse, with very few comments and docstrings, and has to be
rewritten; all the other elisp files in the "to be kept" column should
have enough comments by now - I've been working on that in the last
weeks -, and I think that they are quite close to being of Emacs
quality.

My plan is to release 0.95.1, then do some tests on the new
eev-current to check if it is self-contained - at the moment it
probably still has a few calls to functions that are defined in my
.emacs - then release a 0.95.2, then contact the GNU/FSF people again
to include eev in GNU Emacs.

About the htmlized versions of elisp files: now anyone running CVS GNU
Emacs on a decent OS should be able to reconstruct the html files by
running "make htmls", so they will be dropped out from eev-current
soon. They are generated by these two auxiliary .el files:

   htmlize-all.el
   htmlize-eev.el

Other important things to do soon: update my e-mail address and FSF's
snail-mail address in the headers of many files; update the NEWS file;
convert the article about eev to TeXinfo; rewrite the sections of the
article that discuss the single-steppers; etc, etc, etc.
