old and -current is almost becoming 0.95.1.

News:

<span class="outline-1">* Now eev has a mailing list at Savannah:</span>
  &lt;<a href="http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/eev">http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/eev</a>&gt; (to subscribe, etc),
  &lt;<a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/eev">http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/eev</a>&gt; (for the archive).


<span class="outline-1">* Lots of changes in the documentation, mainly at the file `README'.</span>
  The concepts have become clearer.  See: <a href="README.html">(find-eev "README")</a>


<span class="outline-1">* Installation: the installation procedure involves changing some of</span>
  your rcfiles (.emacs, .bashrc, .zshrc, etc), but now "make
  preinstall" creates the modified files in a temporary directory and
  creates scripts there to install the new versions and also to go
  back to the previous versions. Do "make install" to install the new
  versions and "make uninstall" to uninstall.


<span class="outline-1">* Highlighting:</span>

<span class="outline-2">** F3 now highlights temporarily the bounded region.</span>
   See: <a href="doc/shot-f3.png">(find-eevfile "doc/shot-f3.png")</a>
<span class="outline-2">** M-0 M-e highlight the previous sexp instead of executing it.</span>
   See below for other prefix arguments affecting M-e.


<span class="outline-1">* Many kew kinds of elisp hyperlinks. Here are just a few of them:</span>

<span class="outline-2">** (find-sh COMMAND)  runs COMMAND and shows its output in a buffer.</span>
<span class="outline-2">** (find-sh0 COMMAND) runs COMMAND and shows its output in the echo</span>
   area.
<span class="outline-2">** (find-epp OBJECT)  pretty-prints OBJECT and shows it in a buffer.</span>
<span class="outline-2">** (find-epp0 OBJECT) pretty-prints OBJECT in a compact way and shows</span>
   it in the echo area.
<span class="outline-2">** (find-efunctionpp SYMBOL) pretty-prints the internal representation</span>
   of the function given by SYMBOL.
<span class="outline-2">** (find-estring STRING) shows STRING in a buffer.</span>
<span class="outline-2">** (find-eimage0 FNAME) displays the image FNAME in the current buffer,</span>
   "inlined" - i.e., in place of the sexp.

<span class="outline-2">** Background processes:</span>
<span class="outline-3">*** (eebg-xdvi DVIFILE) starts "xdvi DVIFILE" as a background process.</span>
<span class="outline-3">*** (eebg-gv PSORPDFFILE) starts "gv DVIFILE" as a background process.</span>
<span class="outline-3">*** (eebg-channel-xterm CHANNEL) starts a xterm "listening on CHANNEL".</span>
    See: <a href="doc/shot-f9.png">(find-eevfile "doc/shot-f9.png")</a>



<span class="outline-1">* Keyboard changes:</span>

<span class="outline-2">** eev doesn't change the global keymap anymore. All of eev's key</span>
   sequences are now in `eev-mode-map', and there's a global minor
   mode, `eev-mode', whose only function is to make the `eev-mode-map'
   keymap active. Loading eev.el turns on eev-mode. If you define your
   own version of `eev-mode-map' before loading eev.el then eev.el
   will use your map without modifying it in any way.

<span class="outline-2">** Keys for executing sexps (M-e and M-E):</span>

<span class="outline-3">*** M-e (`eek-eval-sexp-eol') now accepts a prefix argument:</span>

<span class="outline-4">**** M-0 M-e just highlights the sexp temporarily.</span>
<span class="outline-4">**** M-1 M-e shows the text of the sexp in the echo area.</span>
<span class="outline-4">**** M-2 M-e shows the sexp as a list object in the echo area.</span>
<span class="outline-4">**** M-3 M-e executes the sexp without showing the result in the echo area.</span>
<span class="outline-4">**** M-4 M-e executes the sexp with debugging on.</span>
<span class="outline-4">**** M-5 M-e executes the sexp with `debug-on-error' on.</span>
<span class="outline-4">**** M-8 M-e executes the sexp and pretty-prints its output in a buffer.</span>
<span class="outline-4">**** M-9 M-e executes an `(interactive ...)' clause in a useful way.</span>

<span class="outline-3">*** M-E (`eek-eval-last-sexp') acts like M-e, but without moving point to</span>
    end-of-line first.

<span class="outline-2">** Keys for getting rid of unwanted bufers (M-k and M-K):</span>
   M-k now runs `kill-this-buffer' instead of `kill-buffer'.
   `kill-buffer' always asked for a confirmation, while
   `kill-this-buffer' usually only asks when the buffer is modified
   and is associated to a file. M-K runs `bury-buffer'.

<span class="outline-2">** Keys for generating temporary buffers with lists of hyperlinks:</span>
   M-h M-k (`find-ekey-links')      - for an Emacs key sequence
   M-h M-f (`find-efunction-links') - for Elisp function
   M-h M-v (`find-evariable-links') - for an Elisp variable
   M-h M-i (`find-einfo-links')     - for Info nodes
   M-h M-m (`find-manpage-links')   - manpage for command at point
   M-h m   (`find-last-manpage-links') - current manpage
   M-h f   (`find-file-links')      - for the current file
   M-h M-d (`find-debpkg-links')    - for a Debian package

<span class="outline-2">** Keys for refining hyperlinks:</span>
   M-h 2 or M-h M-2 (`eemklinks-duplicate-this-line') and
   M-h M-y ('eemklinks-yank-pos-spec'). These are better illustrated
   by an example; see the documentation for the function `eesteps' for
   how to run it.

     (eesteps '(
       <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/Lisp-Eval.html">(find-enode "Lisp Eval")</a>
       (search-forward "`defvar'")
       "C-SPC C-SPC 8*&lt;left&gt;"
       "M-w"     
       "M-h M-i"
       (search-forward "find-enode")
       "M-h M-2"
       "M-h M-y"
       "C-a"
       "C-SPC C-SPC &lt;down&gt;"
       "M-w"
       "C-x b *scratch*"
       "C-y"
       "M-e"
     ))


<span class="outline-1">* `eesteps': support for programming a series of Emacs actions and</span>
  executing them one by one; by default the key to execute the next
  action is &lt;f12&gt;. See: <a href="eev-dev.el.html#eesteps">(find-eev "eev-dev.el" "eesteps")</a>


<span class="outline-1">* Support for running external programs and sending them input one</span>
  line at a time without having to switch out from Emacs. There's a
  "commented screenshot" showing this in action:

    <a href="doc/shot-f9.png">(find-eevfile "doc/shot-f9.png")</a>
    &lt;<a href="http://angg.twu.net/eev-current/doc/shot-f9.png">http://angg.twu.net/eev-current/doc/shot-f9.png</a>&gt;

  and here are some links to relevant files and functions:

    <a href="eegchannel.html">(find-eev "eegchannel")</a>
    <a href="eev-dev.el.html#eechannel-do-this-line">(find-eev "eev-dev.el" "eechannel-do-this-line")</a>


<span class="outline-1">* Support for running programs inside Emacs and sending commands to</span>
  them one line at a time. See:

    (find-efunctiondescr 'eepitch-this-line)
  



Note: this file is incomplete - as all the documentation of eev - but
I've been delaying the release for too long!

About the htmlization of this file: I find the default colors of
outline-mode ugly, so I changed changed them...

  (require 'htmlize-eev)
  (my-outline-colors)

<span class="outline-1">* Foo</span>
<span class="outline-2">** bar</span>
<span class="outline-3">*** plic</span>
<span class="outline-4">**** bletch</span>
