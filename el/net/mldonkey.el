Hi,


There's a new version out which fixes the problems with new
MlDonkey versions.  I also fixed some small bugs (and maybe added
some new bugs).

Description:

MLDonkey is a peer to peer application for accessing the
Edonkey2000 network as well as a few others like Overnet,
FastTrack, Bittorrent, Gnutella and SoulSeek.

mldonkey.el is written in elisp and allows you to monitor your
downloads and control the MLDonkey core from within your emacs.
