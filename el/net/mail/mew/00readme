This is the stable release of Mew 4.2.

			     <Platforms>

Please use Emacs 20.7 or Emacs 21.3 or later (including the CVS
version of Emacs). Mew doesn't support earlier versions. (Mew may work
on XEmacs 21.1.14 or later but Mew does not support it officially
anymore.)

			    <Installation>

(1) Type './configure'.

(2) Type 'make'.

(2.1) Mew's info is formatted by Emacs 21.x. So, the info could not be
visible with other Emacsen. In this case, type 'make info' to format
the info.

(2.2) If you want to format the Japanese info, type 'make jinfo'.

(3) Type 'make install'.

If you have the "install-info" command, the following line will be
automatically added to the "dir" file.  Otherwise, add it by yourself.

(3.1) If you want the Japanese info, type 'make install-jinfo'. If you
